             DNS over HTTPS (DoH) Deployment Considerations
                        draft-dlr-doh-deploy-00

Abstract

   Deployment of DNS over HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484] introduces a major
   change to the way in which devices and applications are able to use
   the Domain Name System.  DoH traffic uses HTTP over a TLS session.
   DoH clients and servers can use HTTP primitives to request and supply
   DNS data instead of conventional DNS queries and responses using port
   53.  This presents a number of challenges, including new risks and
   security concerns.

   The objective of this document is to describe these challenges and
   provide advice on how to minimise their impact.

   It is also likely that DoH servers could be operated and controlled
   by website administrators and developers who are not familiar with
   the DNS.  They may need guidance on how to provide DoH services that
   are aligned with best DNS practices.  This document is intended to
   bridge the gap between the HTTP and DNS communities.

1.  Introduction

   Traditional DNS traffic is not encrypted.  This poses an obvious
   privacy challenge for Internet users, because their access to named
   network resources could potentially be tracked through their DNS
   queries.  Measures like Query Minimisation [RFC7816] can reduce but
   not eliminate this exposure.  In principle, any network element in
   the path between the user and resolver could observe this unencrypted
   traffic.

   DoH partially eliminates this problem by using TLS to encrypt the
   queries and responses that are made.  These use HTTP rather than the
   conventional DNS protocol.  Furthermore DoH traffic is intermingled
   with other HTTPS traffic, making it difficult for an eavesdropper to
   monitor DNS traffic or even be aware that it is taking place.  It
   should be noted however that a user's DNS queries could still be
   monitored by the DoH server(s) which receive them.

   The conventional model for DNS transactions involves a stub resolver,
   resolving servers and authoritative DNS servers.  The stub resolver
   is usually part of the system software and is used by applications to
   make DNS queries and receive responses from recursive servers which
   are typically provided by an ISP or the local network administrator.
   Recursive servers answer queries from stub resolvers by traversing a
   hierarchy of authoritative DNS servers, querying them for data about
   some domain name and ultimately returning that response to the stub
   resolver that initiated the orginal query.

   New models of DNS usage are created with DoH.  A DoH server typically
   occupies the role of the recursive resolving server in conventional
   DNS.  DoH clients send DNS queries to DoH servers over DoH instead of
   using a stub resolver to send plaintext DNS queries to a conventional
   recursive resolving server.  This DoH server will sometimes be
   operated and controlled by a third party - i.e. not whoever operates
   and controls the existing recursive resolver DNS servers in some
   network.  That in turn disrupts the long standing and well understood
   (if sometimes poorly documented) trust relationships in traditional
   DNS.

   HTTP servers would be able to offer DoH service without the need for
   conventional DNS query-response transactions.  For instance, HTTP
   servers could just return application/dns-message elements for the
   URIs in some web page, saving the web client from issuing DoH (or
   plaintext DNS) queries to resolve the hostnames in those URIs.

2.  Terminology

   DoH Server: A server supporting the DNS over HTTPS is called a "DoH
   server" to differentiate it from a "DNS server" (one that only
   provides DNS service over one or more of the other transport
   protocols standardised for DNS).  Similarly, a client that supports
   the DNS over HTTPS is called a "DoH client".

   A detailed glossary of DNS terms can be found in RFC 8499 [RFC8499].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Contrasting DoH and Conventional DNS

   With conventional DNS today, using UDP or TCP port 53, most users are
   assigned the IP addresses of several recursive resolvers via DHCP or
   similar network bootstrapping mechanism.  These are usually the IP
   addresses of recursive resolvers that are administered by the network
   operator.

   When DoH is used, client and server DNS traffic is encrypted using a
   TLS channel, typically to port 443.  DoH clients will generally have
   little need for conventional DNS apart from an initial bootstrap
   query to find the IP addresses of a suitable DoH server.  The bulk of
   their DNS resolver traffic could bypass the current network's DNS
   resolver infrastructure because that traffic will make use of the
   resolver service provided by the DoH server.

   At present there is no standard for DoH server discovery.  Browser
   vendors, who have been first to use DoH, have so far adopted ad-hoc
   solutions.  One approach is to embed the names or URIs for public DoH
   resolvers in the browser's configuration.  Another is to try DoH
   opportunistically: if there is a DoH service at the IP address(es)
   found in the device's stub resolver configuration, the browser uses
   that.

4.  DoH Impact on Existing DNS Behaviour

4.1.  DNS servers using Access Control Lists

   When a DoH server performs the role of a recursive resolving DNS
   server, it queries other DNS or DoH servers to resolve the queries
   received from DoH clients.  These outbound queries will use a source
   IP address of the DoH server, not that of the originating client.
   This may sometimes cause operational or security problems, for
   instance when the DoH server queries another DoH or DNS server that



Dickinson, et al.        Expires April 29, 2021                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            draft-dlr-doh-deploy              October 2020


   uses access control lists based on source IP address.  In this case,
   the ACL applies to the source address of the DoH server and not the
   original DoH client.  That can mean the DoH client eventually gets a
   different response than if it had made the query itself.  In
   particular, this may be a problem for IXFR or AXFR queries because
   authoritative DNS servers commonly use ACLs to restrict these
   queries.

   This problem becomes more acute for dynamic updates [RFC2137].  If an
   ACL based on source IP address is used to accept or reject these
   requests, it will be the address of the DoH server rather than the
   DoH client which determines the outcome.  However Transaction
   Signatures (TSIG) [RFC2845] and GSS-TSIG [RFC3645] are commonly used
   for authenticating dynamic update requests.  It is therefore
   essential that DoH servers do not interfere with any TSIG resource
   records in queries or responses.  DoH servers MUST ensure TSIG
   resource records included in any requests received from DoH clients
   are included whenever the DoH server has to contact another DoH or
   DNS server to satisfy that request.  Similarly, DoH servers MUST
   return to DoH clients any TSIG resource records that are received
   from DNS or DoH servers.

4.2.  Split DNS

   Split DNS configurations [RFC8499] are widely used, particularly in
   enterprise networks.  These have an internal name space which is not
   visible to the public Internet.  Resolving DNS servers in such
   networks are usually configured to only provide answers for this name
   internal space to requests from clients on the enterprise network.

   Applications and devices making DoH requests on networks which use
   split DNS will not be able to access these internal names unless
   their requests are sent to a suitably configured DoH server.  This
   probably means that networks using split DNS SHOULD provide DoH
   servers which are able to provide answers for their internal name
   space.  It therefore follows that networks using split DNS SHOULD
   ensure that DoH clients query local DoH servers which have been
   configured for that network's internal name space.

   Use of third-party DoH servers is not recommended in networks which
   have split DNS.  These servers are unlikely to know about the
   configuration of the local network and will therefore be unable to
   resolve or otherwise properly handle requests for the internal name
   space.  When third-party DoH servers are used in these networks, it
   also presents security and privacy risks.  Requests from DoH clients
   for internal names will leak, disclosing this potentially sensitive
   information to an external DoH server which is operated and
   controlled by a third party.

4.3.  Secure DNS (DNSSEC)

   RFC 8484 explains that interactions between a DoH server and client
   benefit from the transport security provided by HTTPS and that DoH
   does not provide message integrity.  Although a DoH client can be
   sure it received exactly the data sent by a DoH server, it does not
   know if that server is telling the truth.  That can only be
   determined by DNSSEC validation, assuming that the DNS data are
   properly signed.  Therefore a security-conscious DoH client SHOULD
   support DNSSEC and perform DNSSEC validation by itself.  DoH clients
   MAY trust a DoH server to validate signed responses on their behalf
   but MUST take full account of the consequences of doing so.

4.4.  DNS Headers, OP Codes and EDNS Options

   DoH servers MUST check the headers and opcodes on inbound DoH
   requests and act accordingly.  In particular, DoH servers MUST NOT
   assume that those requests are queries unless both the QR bit and
   Opcode header are set to zero.  Relevant header and EDNS bits (DO,
   CD, etc) on incoming queries MUST be reflected in the outgoing DNS or
   DoH queries needed to resolve the original request.  [Remember
   Community DNS treating DNS responses as queries?]

   To do: add clarifications on behaviour around EDNS goop - padding,
   ECN, keepalive, extended error code, DNS cookies, etc

4.5.  Multicast DNS

   Need to say something about this and .local?  Should DoH services
   need to know or care about it?

5.  DoH Impact on Browser Behaviour

5.1.  Browser Caches

   A web browser maintains a cache of recent DNS data.  Responses from
   DoH servers will affect the contents of that cache.  This presents a
   security risk because DoH servers could arbitrarily manipulate the
   content of a browser's cache in a way that would not be possible with
   conventional DNS.  DoH servers may be able to populate a browser's
   cache without the browser making DNS (or DoH) queries by sending
   arbitrary application/dns-message elements in the HTML needed to
   render a web page.

   DoH servers SHOULD NOT send DoH data (i.e. application/dns-message
   elements) unrelated to the request made by a DoH Client.  Similarly,
   a web server SHOULD NOT send DoH data that does not correspond to any
   of the URIs in the HTML which is returned. i.e. If all the URIs on

   some web page are for foo.example.com, the web server SHOULD NOT send
   application/dns-message elements for bar.example.com or example.net.
   DoH clients SHOULD ignore such unrelated DoH data sent by a DoH or
   web server.  DoH clients MUST NOT cache such data.

5.2.  What else?

   There have to be some server PUSH horrors here

   Say something about the evils of web cookies and related spyware
   (trackers, beacons, etc)?

9.  Recommendations

   DoH servers on the public Internet MUST NOT create an alternate root
   or publish data for TLDs that have not been created through ICANN or
   IETF processes.  DoH servers on private networks MAY use alternate
   roots and/or ad-hoc TLDs provided these name spaces do not leak to
   the public Internet.

Internet-Draft            draft-dlr-doh-deploy              October 2020


   The responses received over DoH MUST be available in the traditional
   DNS.

   A DoH server MAY make choices about which RRs to return if it knows
   more about the network or client locality, provided that does not
   compromise DNSSEC validation.

   The DoH server MAY push useful additional RRs to DoH Client if the
   server knows the client is likely to need those RRs soon.  Again,
   these RRs MUST be available in the traditional DNS.

   DoH servers and clients MUST handle unknown RRtypes correctly: ie
   support RFC 3597 [RFC3597].

   DoH servers MUST support DNSSEC validation.

   DoH clients SHOULD support DNSSEC validation.

   DoH servers and clients SHOULD support Transaction Signatures (TSIG).
   Although the message integrity checking offered by TSIG is redundant
   when DNS transactions are carried over a TLS channel, TSIG offers
   protection against replay attacks.  This may be useful for some types
   of DNS transactions.

   DoH servers MUST honour DNS error codes and extended error codes
   [draft-ietf-dnsop-extended-error-16].  These MUST be returned to DoH
   clients.  Use of HTTP error codes SHOULD complement these DNS error
   codes and MUST NOT replace them.  DNS error codes have specific
   meaning and these semantics may not always be readily conveyed in an
   HTTP error code.
