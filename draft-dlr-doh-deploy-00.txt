             DNS over HTTPS (DoH) Deployment Considerations
                        draft-dlr-doh-deploy-00

Abstract

   The development of DNS over HTTPS (DoH), defined in RFC8484,
   introduces a major change to the way in which devices and
   applications are able to use the Domain Name System.  DoH traffic
   uses HTTP over a TLS session.  DoH clients and servers can use HTTP
   primitives to request and supply DNS data instead of conventional DNS
   queries and responses using port 53.  This presents a number of
   challenges, including new risks and security concerns, for those
   operating and running IP-based networks.

   The objective of this document is to describe these challenges and
   provide advice on how to minimise their impact.

Internet-Draft            draft-reid-doh-deploy               March 2019


1.  Introduction

   This document is focussed on DoH deployment issues.  Several of these
   issues also occur in other DNS transports.  However, the authors feel
   that, at this time, consideration of other transports should be made
   in other documents and in the appropriate working groups.

   At present, most traditional DNS traffic is not encrypted.  This can
   pose a privacy challenge for Internet users, because their access to
   named network resources can potentially be tracked through their DNS
   queries.  In principle, any network element along the path between
   the user and resolver could observe this unencrypted traffic.  DoH
   eliminates this problem by using TLS to encrypt the queries and
   responses that are made.  These use HTTP rather than the conventional
   DNS protocol.  Furthermore DoH traffic can be intermingled with other
   HTTPS traffic, making it difficult for an eavesdropper to monitor DNS
   traffic or even be aware that it is taking place.

   A new model of DNS usage is created with DoH.  A DoH server takes on
   the role of the recursive resolving server in conventional DNS.  DoH
   clients send DNS queries to DoH servers over DoH instead of plaintext
   DNS queries to a conventional recursive resolving server.  This DoH
   server is likely to be operated and controlled by a third party -
   i.e. not whoever operates and controls the existing recursive
   resolver DNS servers in some network.  That in turn disrupts the long
   standing and well understood trust relationships in traditional DNS.

2.  Terminology

   DoH Server: A server supporting the DNS over HTTPS is called a "DoH
   server" to differentiate it from a "DNS server" (one that only
   provides DNS service over one or more of the other transport
   protocols standardised for DNS).  Similarly, a client that supports
   the DNS over HTTPS is called a "DoH client".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Contrasting DoH and Conventional DNS

   With conventional DNS today, using UDP or TCP port 53, most users are
   assigned the IP addresses of several recursive resolvers via DHCP or
   similar network bootstrapping mechanism.  These are usually the IP
   addresses of recursive resolvers that are administered by the network
   operator.  Users sometimes also change to third-party recursive
   resolvers.  In some cases, they may even operate their own local
   resolver.

   RFC 8484 defines the protocol for DNS over HTTPS (DoH).  When DoH is
   used, client and server DNS traffic is encrypted using a TLS channel,
   typically to port 443.  DoH clients will have little need for
   conventional DNS apart from an initial bootstrap query to find the IP
   addresses of a suitable DoH server.  This will mean the bulk of their
   DNS resolver traffic would bypass an operator's DNS resolver
   infrastructure because that traffic will make use of the resolver
   service provided by the DoH server.

   DoH displaces the traditional DNS client-server model of clients
   making queries and waiting for a reply from a server.

4.  DoH Impact on Existing DNS Behaviour

4.1.  DNS servers using Access Control Lists

   When a DoH server performs the role of a recursive resolving DNS
   server, it queries other DNS or DoH servers to resolve the queries
   received from DoH clients.  These outbound queries will use a source
   IP address of the DoH server, not the originating client.  This may
   sometimes cause operational or security problems, for instance when
   the DoH server queries another DoH or DNS server that uses access
   control lists based on source IP address.  In this case, the ACL
   applies to the DoH server and not the original DoH client.  That can
   mean the DoH client eventually gets a different response than if it
   made the query itself.  In particular, this may be a problem for IXFR
   or AXFR queries because authoritative DNS servers commonly use ACLs
   to restrict these queries.

   This problem becomes more acute for dynamic updates RFC 2137
   [RFC2137].  If an ACL-based on source IP address is used to accept or
   reject these requests, it will be the address of the DoH server
   rather than the DoH client which determines the outcome.  However
   Transaction Signatures (TSIG) RFC2845 [RFC2845] are more commonly
   used for authenticating dynamic update requests.  It is therefore
   essential for DoH servers to ensure that TSIG resource records
   received from DoH clients are included in outgoing requests.  DoH
   servers MUST ensure TSIG resource records included in any requests
   received from DoH clients are included whenever the DoH server has to
   contact another DoH or DNS server to satisfy that request.
   Similarly, DoH servers MUST return to DoH clients any TSIG resource
   records that are received from DNS or DoH servers.

4.2.  Split DNS

   Split DNS configurations RFC8499 [RFC8499] are widely used,
   particularly in enterprise networks.  These have an internal name
   space which is not visible to the public Internet.  Resolving DNS



Dickinson, et al.      Expires September 12, 2019               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            draft-reid-doh-deploy               March 2019


   servers in such networks are configured to only provide answers for
   this name internal space to requests from clients on the enterprise
   network.  Applications and devices making DoH requests on networks
   which use split DNS will not be able to access these internal names
   unless their requests are sent to a suitably configured DoH server.
   This probably means that networks using split DNS SHOULD provide DoH
   servers which are able to provide answers for the internal name
   space.

   Use of third-party DoH servers is not recommended in networks which
   have split DNS.  These servers are unlikely to know about the
   configuration of the local network and will therefore be unable to
   resolve or otherwise properly handle requests for the internal name
   space.  This also presents security and privacy risks.  Requests from
   DoH clients for internal names will leak, disclosing sensitive
   information to an external DoH server which is operated and
   controlled by a third party.  DoH clients on networks using split DNS
   SHOULD query DoH servers which have been configured for that
   network's internal name space.

4.3.  Secure DNS (DNSSEC)

   RFC 8484 [RFC8484] explains that interactions between a DoH server
   and client benefit from the transport security provided by HTTPS and
   that DoH does not provide message integrity.  Put simply, although a
   DoH client can be sure it received exactly the data sent by a DoH
   server, it does not know if that server is telling the truth.  That
   can only be verified by DNSSEC validation, assuming that the DNS data
   are signed.  Therefore a security-conscious DoH client SHOULD support
   DNSSEC and perform DNSSEC validation by itself.  In some
   circumstances, a DoH client MAY trust a DoH server to validate signed
   responses on their behalf but MUST take full account of the
   conseqences of doing so.

4.4.  Multicast DNS

   Need to say something about this and .local

5.  DoH Impact on Web Behaviour

5.1.  Browser Caches

   A web browser maintains a cache of recent DNS data.  Responses from
   DoH servers will affect the contents of that cache.  This presents a
   security risk because it provides a way for DoH servers to
   arbitrarily manipulate the content of a browser's cache that would
   not be possible with conventional DNS.

   DoH servers SHOULD NOT send DoH data (i.e. application/dns-message
   elements) unrelated to the request made by a DoH Client.  Similarly,
   a web server SHOULD NOT send DoH data that does not correspond to any
   of the URIs in the HTML which is returned. i.e. If all the URIs on
   some web page are for foo.example.com, the web server SHOULD NOT send
   application/dns-message elements for bar.example.com or example.net.
   DoH clients SHOULD ignore such unrelated DoH data sent by a DoH or
   web server.  DoH clients MUST NOT cache such data.

   Browser caches MUST respect the TTL in the response DNS RRSet.

   The responses received over DoH MUST be available in the traditional
   DNS.

   The DoH server MAY make choices about which RRs to return if it knows
   more about the network topology.

   The DoH server MAY push useful additional RRs if it knows the client
   is likely to need them soon.  Again, they MUST be available in the
   traditional DNS.

   DoH servers MUST support DNSSEC.

   DoH clients SHOULD support DNSSEC.
