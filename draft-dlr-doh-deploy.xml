      <t>
	The development of DNS over HTTPS (DoH), defined in RFC8484, introduces a major change to
	the way in which devices and applications are able to use the Domain Name System. DoH traffic
	uses HTTP over a TLS session. DoH clients and servers can use HTTP primitives to request and
	supply DNS data instead of conventional DNS queries and responses using port 53. This
	presents a number of challenges, including new risks and security concerns, for those
	operating and running IP-based networks.
      </t>
      <t>
	The objective of this document is to describe these challenges and provide advice on how to
	minimise their impact.

<section title="Introduction">
    <t>
      This document is focussed on DNS over HTTPS (DoH) deployment issues. Several of these issues also occur in 
      other DNS transports. However, the authors feel that, at this time, consideration of other
      transports should be made in other documents and in the appropriate working groups.
    </t>
    <t>
      At present, traditional DNS traffic is not encrypted. This can pose a privacy challenge for
      Internet users, because their access to named network resources can potentially be tracked
      through their DNS queries because, theoretically speaking, any network element along the path between the user
      and resolver could observe this and any other unencrypted traffic. DoH eliminates this problem by using TLS
      to encrypt the queries and responses that are made, though it may introduce other challenges. DoH-based queries and responses use HTTP rather than the
      conventional DNS protocol. Furthermore, DoH traffic can be intermingled with other HTTPS traffic,
      making it difficult for a potential eavesdropper to monitor DNS traffic, or for a party to block or 
	    modify DNS responses, or even be aware that DNS lookups are taking place.
    </t>
    <t>
      A new model of DNS usage is created with DoH. A DoH server takes on the role of the recursive
      resolving server in conventional DNS. DoH clients send DNS queries to DoH servers over DoH
      instead of plaintext DNS queries to a conventional recursive resolving server. This DoH server
      seems likely to be operated and controlled by a third party - i.e. not whoever operates and
      controls the existing recursive resolver DNS servers in some network. That in turn disrupts
      the long standing and well understood trust and operational relationships in traditional DNS.
    </t>
</section>


<section title="Terminology">
  <t>
    DoH Server: A server supporting the DNS over HTTPS is called a "DoH server" to differentiate it
    from a "DNS server" (one that only provides DNS service over one or more of the other transport
    protocols standardised for DNS).  Similarly, a client that supports the DNS over HTTPS is called
    a "DoH client". The DoH server is a recursive resolver, handling DNS queries from end users/devices, 
	  rather than an authoritative DNS server.
  </t>
  <t>
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
    "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
    <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
</section>


<section title="Contrasting DoH and Conventional DNS">
  <t>
    With conventional DNS today, using UDP or TCP port 53, most users are assigned the IP addresses
    of several recursive resolvers via DHCP or similar network bootstrapping mechanism. These are
    usually the IP addresses of recursive resolvers that are administered by the network
    operator. Users sometimes also change to third-party recursive resolvers. In some cases, they
    may even operate their own local resolver. In a small minority of cases, a network operator may also 
	  choose to forward DNS queries on to an independently operated recursive resolver.
  </t>
  <t>
    <xref target="RFC848"/> defines the protocol for DNS over HTTPS (DoH). When DoH is used, client and recursive server DNS
    traffic is encrypted using a TLS channel, typically using TCP port 443. DoH clients will have little
    need for conventional DNS apart from an initial bootstrap query to find the IP addresses of a
    suitable DoH server. This will mean the bulk of their DNS resolver traffic would bypass an
    operator's DNS resolver infrastructure because that traffic will make use of the resolver
    service provided by the DoH server.
  </t>
  <t>
    DoH displaces the traditional DNS client-server model of clients making queries and waiting for
    a reply from a server.
  </t>
</section>


<section title="DoH Impact on Existing DNS Behaviour">
  <section title="DNS servers using Access Control Lists">
       <t>
	When a DoH server performs the role of a recursive resolving DNS server, it queries other
	DNS or DoH servers to resolve the queries received from DoH clients. These outbound queries
	will use a source IP address of the DoH server, not the originating client. This may
	sometimes cause operational or security problems, for instance when the DoH server queries
	another DoH or DNS server that uses access control lists based on source IP address. In this
	case, the ACL applies to the DoH server and not the original DoH client. That can mean the
	DoH client eventually gets a different response than if it made the query itself. In
	particular, this may be a problem for IXFR or AXFR queries because authoritative DNS servers
	commonly use ACLs to restrict these queries.
       </t>
       <t>
       This problem becomes more acute for dynamic updates <xref target="RFC2137">RFC
       2137</xref>. If an ACL-based on source IP address is used to accept or reject these requests,
       it will be the address of the DoH server rather than the DoH client which determines the
       outcome. However Transaction Signatures (TSIG) <xref target="RFC2845">RFC2845</xref> are more
       commonly used for authenticating dynamic update requests. It is therefore essential for DoH
       servers to ensure that TSIG resource records received from DoH clients are included in
       outgoing requests. DoH servers MUST ensure TSIG resource records included in any requests
       received from DoH clients are included whenever the DoH server has to contact another DoH or
       DNS server to satisfy that request. Similarly, DoH servers MUST return to DoH clients any TSIG
       resource records that are received from DNS or DoH servers.
       </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Split DNS">
       <t>
	Split DNS configurations <xref target="RFC8499">RFC8499</xref> are widely used, particularly
	in enterprise networks. These have an internal name space which is not visible to the public
	Internet. Resolving DNS servers in such networks are configured to only provide answers for
	this name internal space to requests from clients on the enterprise network. Applications and
	devices making DoH requests on networks which use split DNS will not be able to access these
	internal names unless their requests are sent to a suitably configured DoH server. This
	probably means that networks using split DNS SHOULD provide DoH servers which are able to
	provide answers for the internal name space.  
       </t>
       <t>
       Use of third-party DoH servers is not recommended in networks which have split DNS. These
       servers are unlikely to know about the configuration of the local network and will therefore
       be unable to resolve or otherwise properly handle requests for the internal name space. This 
       also presents security and privacy risks. Requests from DoH clients for internal names will
       leak, disclosing sensitive information to an external DoH server which is operated and
       controlled by a third party.  DoH clients on networks using split DNS SHOULD query DoH
       servers which have been configured for that network's internal name space.  
       </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Secure DNS (DNSSEC)">
    <t>
      <xref target="RFC8484">RFC 8484</xref> explains that interactions between a DoH server and
      client benefit from the transport security provided by HTTPS and that DoH does not provide
      message integrity. Put simply, although a DoH client can be sure it received exactly the data
      sent by a DoH server, it does not know if that server is telling the truth. That can only be
      verified by DNSSEC validation, assuming that the DNS data are signed. Therefore a
      security-conscious DoH client SHOULD support DNSSEC and perform DNSSEC validation by
      itself. In some circumstances, a DoH client MAY trust a DoH server to validate signed
      responses on their behalf but MUST take full account of the conseqences of doing so.
    </t>

	   Need to say something about this and .local
	 </t>
  </section>
</section>


<section title="DoH Impact on Web Behaviour">
  <section title="Browser Caches">
    <t>
      A web browser maintains a cache of recent DNS data. Responses from DoH servers will affect the
      contents of that cache. This presents a security risk because it may provide a way for DoH
      servers to arbitrarily manipulate the content of a browser's cache that would not be possible
      with conventional DNS.
    </t>
    <t>
      DoH servers SHOULD NOT send DoH data (i.e. application/dns-message elements) unrelated to the
      request made by a DoH Client. Similarly, a web server SHOULD NOT send DoH data that does not
      correspond to any of the URIs in the HTML which is returned. i.e. If all the URIs on some web
      page are for foo.example.com, the web server SHOULD NOT send application/dns-message elements
      for bar.example.com or example.net. DoH clients SHOULD ignore such unrelated DoH data sent by
      a DoH or web server. DoH clients MUST NOT cache such data.
    </t>
    <t>
      Browser caches MUST respect the TTL in the response DNS RRSet.
